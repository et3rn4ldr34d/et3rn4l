## Lightweight Bounty Automation Control Hub

The idea of this repo is to create an aggregation hub app for bounty automation.

## How it works

I mainly wanted to help automate and speed up the bounty process by adding an interface and scaling automation to an all-in-one location.

Over time, this app should become a swiss-army-knife of sorts, where you can run it on a VPS.

The goal is to first design a minimal CLI aggregate tool.  Eventually it would be nice to expand this to include a private webserver, vpn, and more, so that when you want to perform bug bounty, you can install this app on a VPS to pair along with tools like Burp or ZAP.

Most likely features will be added in an incremental basis.

## Instructions

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
